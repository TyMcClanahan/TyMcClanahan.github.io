    <h3>My Based Porfolio Artifacts are as follows:</h3>
    <h4>Spring 2022 // Boomerang Billy</h4>
    <p>This was a mobile game that I made for my senior project in high school. It has quite a
        few problems but I was responsible for every step of the project including programming, art,
        music and deploying it onto the Google Play Store. I made it with Unity, C#, MS Paint, and Bosca
        Ceoil.</p>
    <h4>Spring 2023 // Construct TD</h4>
    <p>This was one of the first projects I did for college. It was a 2D tower defense game where
        you kill robots, collect those parts with your player, then build turrets to defend your base using
        the robot scrap. Made With Unity, C#, and MS Paint
    </p>
    <h4>Fall 2023 // Personal Chess Data Website</h4>
    <p>I made a website that has all of my lichess games that I have ever played that tracks my
        improvement over the years. This website had me practicing HTML, CSS, and using D3 for a
        pleasant user experience.</p>
    <h4>Winter 2023 // Overgrown</h4>
    <p>I entered a 2 week long game on the topic of 'Overgrown.' I made a top down endless
        shooter survival game where the player has five unique weapons to defend themselves against
        an endless stream of killer plants. It ended up winning 'Best Game Play' for the jam. Made with
        Unity, C#, MS Paint, and Bosca Ceoil.</p>
    <h4>Winter 2024 // Beyond the Frontier</h4>
    <p>This is another game jam project that I did in ten days. This was a 3D game from an
        angled top down view where you fight aliens with a sword. The setting of the game was on the
        moon so I had to have a gravity system to where the player is sucked towards the planet and is
        rotated to where they are facing upwards. Won third place for the jam. Made with Unity, C#, MS Paint, Bosca
        Ceoil, Maya,
        and Adobe Substance 3D Painter</p>
